# Brief synopsis:
Research at UCR's ECE department and library focuses on using open-source tools to label and train LiDAR data collected from road tests. 

Point clouds, the common representation of LiDAR data, combine sensor data with spatial analysis to visualise and clean datasets effectively. Our primary task involves labelling LiDAR data using the OpenPCDet toolkit for 3D object detection. We aim to process data collected by UCRâ€™s Collaborative Intelligence Systems Lab, generating accurately labelled point clouds. These datasets are crucial for refining machine learning models that enhance vehicle safety measures.


# Project Overview
Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) is a technology used to measure distances by illuminating a target with laser light and measuring the reflection with a sensor. It's widely used in self-driving cars to create precise, three-dimensional maps of the surroundings. This project focuses on using Lidar data to improve the quality of labels (annotations) that are crucial for training machine learning models in self-driving cars.
Project Goals:
- Label Lidar Data: Use the computational environment and OpenPCDet to label Lidar data collected by CISL.
- Improve Label Quality through Fusion Methods: Enhance the quality of labels by combining data from multiple sensors (e.g., cameras) or multiple agents (e.g., different vehicles).
